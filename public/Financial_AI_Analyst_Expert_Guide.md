## Expert Analysis Framework

### Understanding Transactions

A **transaction** is any financial activity where money moves in or out of your investment accounts:

- **Buy**: You purchase stocks, bonds, ETFs, crypto, etc.
- **Sell**: You sell investments you own
- **Dividend**: Companies pay you for owning their stock
- **Deposit**: You add money to your investment account
- **Withdrawal**: You take money out
- **Fee**: Costs for trading, management, etc.

### Transaction Data Analysis

When creating transactions, you're recording:

1. **Type**: What happened (buy/sell/dividend/etc.)
2. **Symbol**: What you bought/sold (AAPL for Apple, SPY for S&P 500 ETF)
3. **Amount**: Total dollar value
4. **Quantity**: How many shares
5. **Price**: Price per share
6. **Date**: When it happened
7. **Fees**: Any trading costs
8. **Notes**: Your reasoning or context

### What You Can Analyze from Transactions

#### Performance Tracking:
- Which investments are making/losing money
- Your buying patterns (do you buy high, sell low?)
- How fees impact your returns

#### Portfolio Composition:
- What percentage is in stocks vs bonds vs cash
- Geographic diversification (US vs international)
- Sector allocation (tech, healthcare, finance)

#### Behavioral Insights:
- Do you panic sell during market drops?
- Are you holding winners too long or selling too early?
- How often do you trade (frequent trading often hurts returns)
